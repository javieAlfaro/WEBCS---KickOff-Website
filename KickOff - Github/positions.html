            <h2>Forward:</h2>
            <h3>Striker</h3>
                <p>Strikers are players who are positioned nearest to the opposing team's goal. The primary responsibility of forwards is to score goals and to create scoring chances for other players.</p>
            <h3>Centre forward</h3>
                <p>A centre forward has the key task of scoring goals and for this reason acts as the focal point of the majority of attacking play by a team.</p>
            <h3>Winger</h3>
                <p>A winger (left winger and right winger) is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines. Speed is usually a winger’s main attribute which is used to attack and dribble past opponent’s full-backs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="position-column">
            <h2>Midfielder:</h2>
            <h3>Central midfielder</h3>
                <p>The central midfielder provides a link between defence and attack, fulfilling a number of duties and operating primarily in the middle third of the pitch.</p>
            <h3>Defensive midfielder</h3>
                <p>A defensive midfielder is a central midfielder who is stationed in front of the defenders to provide more defensive protection, thus “holding back” when the rest of the midfield supports the attack.</p>
            <h3>Attacking midfielder</h3>
                <p>An attacking midfielder is a midfield player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position, usually between central midfield and the team’s forwards, and who has a primarily offensive role.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="position-column">
            <h2>Defender:</h2>
            <h3>Centre-back</h3>
                <p>The principal role of the centre-back is to block the opponent’s players from scoring, and safely clearing the ball from the defensive half's penalty area.</p>
            <h3>Full-back</h3>
                <p>The left-back and the right-back (generally referred to as the full-backs) are the defenders stationed at either side of the centre-backs to provide protection from attacking wide players.</p>
            <h3>Wing-back</h3>
                <p>The wing-backs (or attacking full-backs) are defenders with a more advanced emphasis on attack. The name is a portmanteau of “winger” and “full-back,” indicating greater emphasis on their responsibilities in attack.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="goalkeeper-section">
            <h2>Goalkeeper</h2>
                <p>Goalkeeper is the most defensive position in football. The goalkeeper’s main job is to stop the other team from scoring by catching, palming or punching the ball from shots, headers and crosses. Unlike their teammates, goalkeepers typically remain in and around their own penalty area for most of the game.</p>
                <p>Goalkeepers are the only players on the pitch who are allowed to handle the ball, but this is restricted to their own penalty area. Positioning is another important job and is one of the hardest to master as keeper.</p>
            <h3>Sweeper-keeper</h3>
                <p>With the advent of the offside rule, the role of a sweeping defender has largely become obsolete. However, in the last decades it has become popular for goalkeepers to take on that role instead. A sweeping goalkeeper is good at reading the game, and prevents scoring opportunities by coming off their line to challenge and/or distract opposing forwards who have beaten the offside trap.</p>
