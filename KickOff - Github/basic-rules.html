        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Offside:</h2>
            <p>A player is offside if they are closer to the opponent's goal line than the second-last defender when the ball is passed to them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Fouls:</h2>
            <p>Players can be penalized for various fouls, such as tripping, pushing, or tackling recklessly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Throw-ins:</h2>
            <p>Awarded when the ball goes out of bounds over the sideline. The team that did not last touch the ball before it went out of bounds gets the throw-in.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Goal Kick:</h2>
            <p>A goal kick is awarded to the defending team when the attacking team kicks the ball out of bounds over the goal line. The defending team kicks the ball from within their own goal area to restart play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Penalty Kick:</h2>
            <p>A penalty kick is awarded when a serious foul occurs within the penalty area. The offended team is granted a direct free kick from the penalty spot, with only the goalkeeper defending the goal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Freekick:</h2>
            <p>A free kick is awarded when a foul occurs, such as tripping or pushing an opponent. The type of free kick (direct or indirect) depends on the severity of the foul. A direct free kick allows a goal to be scored directly, while an indirect free kick requires the ball to be touched by another player before a goal can be scored.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Corner Kick:</h2>
            <p>A corner kick is awarded when the defending team kicks the ball out of bounds over the goal line. The attacking team takes the kick from the corner of the field nearest to where the ball went out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Handball:</h2>
            <p>Deliberately touching the ball with the hand or arm is a foul, unless it's the goalkeeper within their penalty area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>Cards (Yellow and Red):</h2>
            <p>A yellow card is a warning for minor fouls, while a red card results in immediate ejection for serious fouls or unsporting behavior.</p>
